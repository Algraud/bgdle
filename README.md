This is a hobby project.

This page also serves as an Issue tracker.

This is made possible by BGG XML API. Thank you for supplying the data for this to work.

TODO list:
* Add Board game localization.
* ~~Add How to play (instead of wall of text).~~
* Add ability to play previous dates.
* Make logged in stats better looking.
* Some other Hints, maybe unveiling properties.
* ~~Redo Welcome screen.~~
* Add Free-play.

Possible additions (need research):
* Add BGG rank ranges - variable information, updates will stress API and server.
* Add Weight property - also variable information, updates might stress.
* Some other Hints, maybe unveiling properties - hoping to not change gameplay loop too much.
* Collection mode - might add too many games and stress server.
* light game mode - bgg1000 is heavy games inclined, would love to have a mode for lighter games.
* Add board game family property as a list - Mainly a design element problem of fitting in a 5th list.
